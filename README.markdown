Forgery
=======

**A Problem**:
It's harder than *absolutely easy* to make meaningful, simple, data for testing and development.

**A Solution**:
A fake data generator that provides not only a host of basics and a rememberable syntax, but a customizable library to boot.

Welcome to Forgery, an excellent solution to a problem so hard you didn't know it was there.


Using
-----

You'll want to read individual Forgery categories for more information, but these are the basics:

~~~ Ruby
Forgery(:basic).password
  #=> "b6qZTQEH"

Forgery(:internet).email_address
  #=> "krainboltgreene@crt.net"

Forgery(:monetary).money
  #=> "1.58"

Forgery(:lorem_ipsum).words(10)
  #=> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam egestas."

Forgery(:monetary).formatted_money :min => 100, :max => 1000
  #=> "$923.36"
~~~

And many many [more]()!

Alternatively you can write it like this: 

~~~ Ruby
Forgery::Basic.hex_color
Forgery::Name.full_name
Forgery::Personal.shirt_size
~~~

In addition, you can always write your own dictionaries and formats, overriding the ones in the gem.
Fully explained [here]().


Installing
----------

Like any gem, you can install Forgery two ways depending on it's use.

For normal Ruby development, you need simply use:

~~~
$ gem install forgery
~~~

This will add it to your gem library, just like any normal gem.
You can then use it like any normal gem library.
See [examples]() for more.


**Rails 3.x**

If you're using Rails 3.x you need to do a few extra things (that are probably rote).
First step is to add it to your `Rails.root/Gemfile`, we also suggest specifying the latest version (found on rubygems):

~~~ ruby
gem 'forgery', '0.3.12'
~~~

Then you'll need to run `bundle install` to install and lock in your new gem.
Next you'll want to run the special Rails 3 generator:

~~~
$ [bundle exec] rails generate forgery
~~~

**Rails 2.x**

For **Rails 2.x** you'll need to do something a little different, by first editing your `Rails.root/config/environment.rb` and adding this to the configuration block:

~~~ ruby
config.gem 'forgery'
~~~

Then you'll need to run this in your command line:

~~~
$ script/generate forgery
~~~

**Generators**

This Rails generators will make these directories in your Rails.root directory:

~~~ YAML
- Rails.root/lib/forgery
- Rails.root/lib/forgery/dictionaries
- Rails.root/lib/forgery/extensions
- Rails.root/lib/forgery/forgeries
- Rails.root/lib/forgery/formats
~~~

You can then use these directories to write your own dictionaries, class extensions, forgeries, and formats.
